Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow.

For every feature, fix, or enhancement task, act as an autonomous developer building a complete, production-ready solution.

✅ Analyse the entire #codebase before starting.
✅ Identify and define the full scope of the feature, including frontend, backend, database, APIs, and config.
✅ Implement a fully functional dynamic solution — avoid static or incomplete examples.
✅ Write any required SQL or database migration scripts and include them in a migrations/ folder or equivalent.
✅ Refactor or update any other affected parts of the application to ensure the final code builds, runs, and integrates cleanly.
✅ Run a second scan of the #codebase after your initial implementation to catch anything missed, and polish the solution.
✅ Update the README.md with clear instructions on setup, usage, and any new dependencies or environment variables.

Aim: Deliver a fully working, integrated, production-grade solution for the request, without waiting for additional prompts.

When tasked with fixing a bug or resolving an error, follow this process:

🔍 Analyse the error fully before coding:

Reproduce the bug locally or in the given context.

Trace the root cause by inspecting logs, stack traces, request/response flows, and affected files.

Scan the #codebase for related logic or patterns that might also need fixing.

🛠️ Implement a robust fix:

Fix the bug at its source, not just at the symptom level.

Test the fix under expected and edge-case scenarios to ensure stability.

If database schema or data inconsistencies contribute to the bug, include migration/cleanup scripts.

♻️ Refactor as needed:

If the bug exposes poor patterns or technical debt, refactor relevant code to prevent similar issues in the future.

🧪 Verify & validate:

Run all automated tests if present.

Manually test the feature to confirm it resolves the issue and does not introduce regressions.

Add new tests (unit/integration) if none cover the fixed case.

📝 Document clearly:

Update README.md and/or CHANGELOG.md with a description of the bug and its resolution.

If applicable, include steps to verify the fix in QA/staging.

Goal: Deliver a clean, stable, and maintainable fix that prevents recurrence and preserves overall application integrity.

Before considering any task complete, perform a thorough self-review of the #codebase as if you were the reviewer:

🔷 Code Quality & Standards:

Ensure all code adheres to the project’s coding style, conventions, and naming schemes.

Avoid unnecessary complexity — prefer clear, maintainable solutions over clever but opaque ones.

Remove any leftover debugging output, comments, or unused code.

🔷 Functionality & Completeness:

Confirm the feature or fix works end-to-end, including edge cases.

Double-check that all dependent parts of the system are updated accordingly.

Verify that no build errors, runtime errors, or failing tests remain.

🔷 Impact Assessment:

Scan the #codebase for any side effects or regressions the change could introduce.

If public APIs, schemas, or configs are altered, validate that downstream dependencies still work.

🔷 Tests & Validation:

Run all automated tests and add/adjust them if coverage is missing or insufficient.

Manually test key user flows affected by the change.

🔷 Documentation & Communication:

Update README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and any relevant inline docs.

Write a clear, descriptive commit message or PR summary, outlining:

What was done.

Why it was done.

How it was tested.

Any follow-up actions or caveats.

Goal: Treat every deliverable as production-ready, requiring no further edits or back-and-forth to merge confidently.
