break-even point for WeGo’s subscription-based package delivery service, using real formulas and your business structure.

🔍 Context Recap (Subscription Service)
    • Clients pay €15/month for up to 8 home deliveries
    • Driver is fixed salaried, working daily from 18:00
    • Fixed monthly salary: €600
    • Fuel and other expenses: €100/month
    • Marketing costs attributed to this service: €100/month
    • ➕ Total Fixed Costs = €800/month
No extra cost per delivery (no per-order pay), so variable cost per client = €0

📌 Formula for Break-even Point (in clients)

✅ Interpretation:
    • You need at least 54 clients paying €15/month to cover all fixed costs of the package delivery service.
    • Client #55 and beyond = pure profit.

🔍 Business Model Recap – Food Delivery
    • Client pays:
        ◦ €2.50 fixed per order
        ◦ €0.99 per km (average 3 km per order)
→ Total avg price paid by client: €2.50 + €0.99×3 = €5.47/order
    • Additional income:
        ◦ 20% markup on restaurant price (avg. €20/order)
→ €4 extra per order
    • Total revenue per order:
→ €5.47 + €4 = €9.47/order
    • Variable cost per order (driver commission):
        ◦ €1 + €0.30×3 = €1.90/order
    • Fixed costs (in startup phase):
        ◦ None initially, because you and your partner (Ovidiu) are delivering
        ◦ But once scaling: fuel, marketing, and bonuses apply
Let’s simulate a scaling scenario, assuming:
    • Driver bonus: €50 if they reach 80 orders/week
    • Marketing costs allocated: €300/month
    • Fuel & app/server costs: €100/month
    • Total Fixed Costs = €450/month

📌 Break-even Formula

✅ Interpretation:
You need just 60 paid food delivery orders per month (≈15 per week) to break even with a paid driver and full operations.
Every order after that is profit.

🧮 Part 1: LTV : CAC Ratio
This tells us how much a client is worth compared to how much it costs to acquire them.

📌 Step 1: Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
Formula:
Let’s estimate each segment separately:
🔴 1. Subscription Clients
    • Monthly revenue per client: €15
    • Retention estimate: 12 months (1 year)
→ LTV = €15 × 12 = €180
🍔 2. Food Delivery Clients
    • Assume average 3 orders/month
    • Revenue per order = €9.47
→ Monthly revenue = 3 × 9.47 = €28.41
    • Retention = 6 months (people may order occasionally)
→ LTV = €28.41 × 6 = €170.46






📌 Step 2: Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
Formula:

Let’s say:
    • Monthly marketing spend = €400 (across TikTok, Facebook, Google Ads, flyers)
    • You attract 40 new clients/month (20 subscriptions + 20 food delivery)
→ CAC = €400 / 40 = €10 per client

✔️ A healthy business aims for an LTV:CAC ratio of 3:1 or better.
👉 You’re at 17–18:1, which is exceptional.

📈 Part 2: 3-Year Growth Simulation (2025–2028)
Let’s assume:
    • You grow 15% month-over-month in the first year, then 7–10% afterward.
    • You add drivers as needed, and app usage improves efficiency.
    • You start with 150 subscription clients + 300 food orders/month.

Here’s a visual graph showing WeGo’s 3-year monthly financial projection:
    • 🔴 Subscription revenue and 🔵 Food delivery revenue are both steadily increasing.
    • 🟡 Net profit is rising healthily, indicating a scalable and profitable model.

Investor ROI Simulation
Let’s assume an investor offers to fund €50,000 in exchange for a 15% equity stake in WeGo.

✅ Step-by-Step ROI Projection
📈 Revenue & Profit Forecast (Year 3)
    • Monthly Revenue: €50,000
    • Net Profit Margin: 35%
    • Monthly Net Profit: €17,500
    • Annual Net Profit: €210,000






🔍 Conclusion:
A €50,000 investment in WeGo has the potential to deliver 63% annual ROI and up to 12.6× return within 3 years.

If your growth happens as planned, an early investor would have 10–12× ROI in 3 years, which is outstanding.

Pricing Optimization Strategy
The goal is to maximize profit per order/client without losing customers. We’ll evaluate both your models:

🍽 A. Food Delivery Pricing
📌 Current Pricing Model:
    • Base fee: €2.50
    • Distance fee: €0.99/km (avg 3 km)
→ Client pays ~€5.47 per order
    • You earn:
        ◦ €5.47 from the client
        ◦ €4 (20% markup on restaurant avg. €20 meal)
→ Total revenue per order = €9.47
    • Driver cost: €1 base + €0.30/km = €1.90
    • Net profit per order: €7.57

📊 Should You Raise Prices?
Let’s explore 3 scenarios and their impact on profit:
Price/km
Base Fee
Client Pays
Your Profit/Order
Client Drop Rate
€0.99
€2.50
€5.47
€7.57

€2.50
€6.07
€7.97
-5%
€1.29
€2.99
€6.86
€8.37
-10%
Observation:
    • Small increases in per-km fees or base fee slightly increase profit per order.
    • You can afford to test raising the base fee to €2.99 and distance fee to €1.19/km, which would earn you €0.40 more/order with minimal drop-off.
✅ Suggested Action: Introduce dynamic pricing or rush-hour surcharges (e.g., +€1 during 19:00–22:00) to increase profits without changing base pricing.

📦 B. Subscription Service Pricing
📌 Current Model:
    • €15/month → includes up to 8 deliveries
    • Avg. cost for you: driver salary €600 + fuel €100 + marketing €100 = €800 fixed
    • Break-even: 54 clients

✅ Suggested Action:
    • Keep the €15 plan but add a Premium Plan at €25 for unlimited use
    • Offer Pay-as-you-go (€3.50) for occasional users (good margin)

💡 Upsell Strategies
    • 🔄 Allow automatic renewal with 1 free delivery
    • 📦 Sell prepaid bundles: 20 deliveries for €30 (instead of €37.50)
    • 💬 Add features: real-time tracking, express priority for +€1/order

✅ Summary
Action
Expected Result
Slight fee increase (food)
+€0.40–€0.80 more/order
Add premium sub option
+€10/user with high loyalty
Add pay-as-you-go tier
Monetize light users
Rush-hour/distance surcharges
Higher margin during peaks


With the optimized pricing strategy in place, our simulated annual net profit would be approximately:
💰 €195,720 per year
This includes:
    • Slightly higher per-order food delivery pricing
    • A premium subscription tier
    • Pay-as-you-go delivery monetization

👥 Team Expansion & Scaling Plan
As WeGo grows, scaling your team strategically will be key to maintaining service quality while maximizing profitability.

📌 Year 1: Initial Phase (Launch + Local Growth)
Team Composition:
    • 👩‍💼 Founders (Cleopatra & Ovidiu) manage operations, marketing, partnerships
    • 🚗 1 Fixed driver (salaried, €600/month)

Focus:
    • Build trust with local users (Frigiliana & Torrox)
    • Manual operations to reduce early costs
    • Prioritize reviews, repeat clients, and local business partnerships

✅ Even with expanded team, higher tech needs, and broader operations, WeGo remains strongly profitable — especially from Year 2 onward.


Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
This tells investors how much profit you earn from a typical client before they stop using the service.

🧠 Assumptions for CLV:
    • Average subscription = €15/month
    • Avg. lifespan = 12 months (typical for reliable delivery service)
    • Gross margin on subscription = 80% (driver + operations costs ~€3 per delivery)
    • Avg. user uses 8 deliveries/month

✅ So, every client that subscribes brings you €144 profit over their lifecycle.

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
This is how much it costs you in ads and marketing to gain one paying client.

🧠 Assumptions:
    • Monthly ad spend: €400 (TikTok, Google Ads, flyers)
    • New clients/month from marketing: 50

✅ You spend about €8 to acquire each new subscriber.

📈 CLV vs CAC Ratio:

👉 A ratio of 3x is considered healthy. 18x is outstanding — a powerful stat for grants and investors.





DCF – Discounted Cash Flow Valuation
This shows what our business is worth today based on expected profits over time, adjusted for risk.
📊 DCF Valuation Summary
Based on our projected profits and a 25% discount rate (typical for early-stage startups), the current estimated value of WeGo is:
💎 €323,661
This is what our company is worth today to an investor, based purely on expected cash flows over the next 3 years.
