📍1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (Expanded & Refined)
🧭 Overview:
WeGo is a next-generation delivery platform tailored to meet the needs of under-served
communities in the Andalusian region of Spain—starting with Frigiliana and Torrox, where
traditional delivery apps either do not operate or do so partially and inefficiently. Unlike
Glovo, UberEats, or Deliveroo, which focus only on urban centers, WeGo is purpose-built to
reach campo areas (rural countryside zones), where delivery infrastructure is nonexistent.
The company operates with two revenue-generating pillars:
1. Food Delivery Service — where customers can order from local restaurants and
shops using the WeGo app. The founders handle deliveries initially, later supported
by commissioned drivers.
2. Parcel Subscription Service — a unique and scalable monthly plan that enables
customers to receive letters, packages, groceries, or personal goods directly at their
doorstep in campo areas for a fixed monthly fee.
🎯 Problem We Solve:
 In Frigiliana and Torrox, no major app delivers to rural zones (campo), despite a
high number of elderly residents, expats, and remote workers.
 Only one local pizzeria delivers, and it doesn’t go outside town boundaries.
 Residents in campo must drive or walk long distances just to collect a pizza or
receive a letter from the town center.
 Many people, especially older adults and those without cars, are logistically
isolated.
💡 Our Solution:
WeGo makes delivery truly universal. With our app, customers in any area — from central
Frigiliana to the furthest farmhouses — can:
 Order restaurant food, groceries, or other items
 Schedule delivery of letters or personal parcels
 Subscribe to monthly home delivery without worrying about distance
WeGo is community-first, hyperlocal, and structured to be profitable and scalable
through technology, lean logistics, and recurring revenue.
👥 Founding Team:
 Cleopatra Costache – CEO & Chief Operating Officer
Former real estate agent with experience in sales, client service, and rural logistics in
southern Spain. Handles marketing, operations, and customer relationships.
 Ovidiu Niculae – Co-Founder & Head of Logistics
With experience in process coordination and infrastructure, he manages app
development, delivery systems, and local logistics.
Both founders are registered as Autónomos (freelance legal structure in Spain) and plan to
convert to Sociedad Limitada (SL) once monthly revenue exceeds €6,000, ensuring
optimized taxation, hiring flexibility, and eligibility for public funding.
💰 Financial Highlights (Phase 1: 150 active clients)
 Food Delivery:
o 50 orders/day × 30 days = 1,500 monthly orders
o €9.50 avg order value
o WeGo collects: €2.50 + €0.99/km ≈ €7 avg revenue per order
o After cost of delivery (€3.10), profit ≈ €2.30/order
o Monthly profit: 1,500 × €2.30 = €3,450
 Parcel Delivery:
o 150 subscribers on average
o Avg subscription: €28 (weighted across 4 tiers: Basic to Unlimited)
o Avg cost of delivery per user: €5–7/month (bulk delivery, one driver)
o Monthly profit: 150 × ~€23 = €3,450
 Combined Monthly Net Profit: €6,900
 Annual Net Profit (Year 1 projection): €82,800
🏁 Milestones:
Timeline Goal

📂 2. LEGAL STRUCTURE & FOUNDERS
👤 Founding Team
🧭💼 Cleopatra Costache – Co-Founder, CEO & Chief Operations Officer
Cleopatra is a dynamic entrepreneur with a background in real estate, logistics, and small
business development in Andalusia, Spain. Fluent in English, Spanish, and Romanian, she
has extensive knowledge of the needs and pain points of the local community, especially in
rural areas. Her skills in client acquisition, negotiation, and marketing play a vital role in
the growth of WeGo. She will lead:
 Day-to-day operations and strategic direction
 Customer service and support
 Partner onboarding (restaurants, local businesses)
 Offline and online marketing efforts
“I’ve spent years listening to people in campo say, ‘Glovo doesn’t come here.’ So we decided
to build something that finally does.”
🧭💼 Ovidiu Niculae – Co-Founder & Head of Logistics & Technology
Ovidiu brings a practical, solutions-first approach to operations, with experience in process
optimization, transport coordination, and team supervision. He is directly involved in
overseeing:
 Delivery logistics and route planning
 Parcel distribution and daily transport
 Coordination with app developers
 Performance tracking and improvements
Ovidiu will also take part in initial deliveries alongside Cleopatra during the startup phase,
reinforcing WeGo’s hands-on commitment to quality and speed.
🧭 Legal Business Structure
📍 Initial Phase: Autónomos
 Both founders are individually registered as “Autónomos” (self-employed
freelancers) under Spanish law.
 This allows for low start-up costs, simplified tax filing, and full control of expenses.
 Revenue, expenses, and VAT (IVA) obligations will be tracked monthly by a licensed
gestor (accountant).
🔄 Transition Plan: Sociedad Limitada (SL)
WeGo is expected to become a Sociedad Limitada (SL) – the Spanish equivalent of a
Limited Liability Company – once the company achieves consistent monthly revenue above
€6,000 and begins scaling to additional cities.
✅ Benefits of transitioning to SL:
 Legal separation of personal and company finances
 Improved tax structure and access to corporate deductions
 Easier to apply for public grants, EU funds, or private investment
 Capability to hire drivers on payroll, expand operations legally
 Stronger image and credibility for institutional partnerships
📌 Projected transition date: Q2 or Q3 2026, depending on profit margin consistency and
expansion pace.
💼 Third-Party Support
 Gestoría: A licensed gestor will manage monthly bookkeeping, tax declarations
(Modelo 130, 303), quarterly IVA returns, IRPF obligations, and SL incorporation
paperwork.
 App Development Firm: Contracted to build the custom WeGo app (non-white
label). Ongoing support and maintenance agreements will be signed before launch.
 Legal Advisor (Planned for SL phase): A commercial lawyer will be retained to draft
long-term service agreements, data privacy policies (GDPR), and future
franchise/licensing documents.
🏦 Ownership Split
 Cleopatra Costache – 50%
 Ovidiu Niculae – 50%
No external equity is currently held. The company remains 100% founder-owned until such
time that outside investment or funding is strategically pursued.
🚚 3. SERVICES OVERVIEW
WeGo operates under a dual-service model, designed to meet two essential delivery
needs in small towns and rural areas of Spain: on-demand food delivery and
subscription-based parcel delivery. This structure allows WeGo to combine a fast-growth
model (food orders) with a recurring revenue base (subscriptions), while maintaining low
operational complexity.
🍽️ A. On-Demand Food Delivery
🧭 How It Works:
 Clients place orders through the WeGo app
 They can select from a list of local partner restaurants, shops, and minimarkets
 A delivery driver (initially the founders) picks up the order and delivers it to the client's
address — including campo areas where no other app goes
 Clients can also schedule deliveries in advance or leave delivery notes via the app
💰 Monetization Model:
1. Fixed Delivery Fee to Client:
o €2.50 base fee per order
o €0.99 per additional kilometer (beyond 1 km radius)
2. Driver Compensation:
o Each driver receives €1.00 fixed per delivery
o Plus €0.30/km traveled (only outbound km from pick-up to destination)
3. Restaurant Commission:
o Restaurants do not pay upfront.
o Instead, a 20% markup is added to the listed menu prices in the app. This
difference is collected by WeGo.
Example: A €10 pizza on a restaurant’s menu is listed at €12 in WeGo. The €2 margin goes
to WeGo; the restaurant still receives its original €10.
🧭 Financial Simulation (Initial Phase)
 Daily Orders: 50
 Avg Distance/Order: 2.5 km
 Avg Gross Revenue/Order:
€2.50 + (€0.99 x 2.5) ≈ €5.98
 Avg Driver Cost/Order:
€1.00 + (€0.30 x 2.5) = €1.75
 Avg Restaurant Commission:
20% of ~€9.00 = €1.80
 Total Avg Gross Income per Order:
€5.98 + €1.80 = €7.78
 Net Profit per Order:
€7.78 – €1.75 = €6.03
(To be conservative, in financial forecasting we’re assuming a lower profit of €2.30
per order to account for marketing costs, app maintenance, refunds, etc.)
 Monthly Volume: 50 orders/day x 30 = 1,500
 Net Monthly Profit: 1,500 x €2.30 = €3,450
📦 B. Parcel Delivery – Subscription Model
🧭 How It Works:
 Clients sign up for a monthly subscription plan via the app
 They send or transfer their letters/packages to the WeGo drop-off center located in
the village
 Every evening at 18:00, WeGo’s fixed driver delivers the collected parcels across
campo zones
 The model is ideal for:
o Residents without transportation
o Elderly clients
o Remote workers receiving frequent deliveries
o Small businesses in the campo
📦 Subscription Packages (Draft Pricing)
Plan Name Price/Month Max Monthly Deliveries Target Client
Basic €15 4 deliveries Light users, letters
Standard €22 8 deliveries Small parcel users
Extended €35 16 deliveries E-commerce, regular users
Unlimited €55 Unlimited deliveries Businesses, heavy users
All deliveries must originate from the village or local area. Pickup outside this zone will incur
a small extra fee.
🧭 Financial Simulation: 150 Subscribers (Mixed Plans)
 Weighted Avg Subscription Fee: ~€28
 Avg Cost per Subscriber: ~€5/month (one fixed salaried driver, evening route)
 Net Profit per Subscriber: ~€23
 Monthly Profit: 150 × €23 = €3,450
 Driver Salary: €600/month (part-time)
 Fuel & Logistics: ~€150/month
 Net Monthly Margin: already included in the calculation
🛵 Driver Route Structure
 Collection window: 10:00 – 18:00
 Daily delivery route: 18:00 – 20:00
 One fixed driver on contract (€600/month gross salary)
 Efficient delivery model: All packages delivered in one route → no per-delivery cost
increase
📊 Combined Model Advantages
Feature Food Delivery Parcel Delivery
Revenue type Variable Recurring (stable)
Customer use Frequent, daily Weekly to monthly
Cost structure Per delivery Fixed (low)
Market need Immediate Long-term, underserved
Scaling potential High Very high (subscriptions)
📱 4. APP DEVELOPMENT
🎯 Purpose of the App
The WeGo mobile app is the central operational tool of the business. It serves as the
interface between:
 Customers (placing food or parcel delivery orders)
 Delivery drivers (tracking, routing, notifications)
 Local businesses (restaurant/shop order fulfillment)
 Internal operations (admin panel, analytics, reports)
Rather than using a pre-built white-label solution, WeGo has chosen to develop a custom
application from scratch in collaboration with an external tech company. This ensures:
 Full control over the features and roadmap
 No commission paid to third-party platforms
 Flexible adaptation to rural and semi-urban markets

 Scalable subscription-based revenue
📊 7. FINANCIAL FORECAST & BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS
💰 Revenue Streams
WeGo’s financial model relies on two complementary revenue sources:
1. Food Delivery (per order margin)
2. Parcel Delivery Subscription (recurring revenue)
This dual structure ensures both cash flow and stability, which is especially important for
startup growth.
📈 7.1 Food Delivery – Forecast
Assumptions:
 Avg. 50 orders/day × 30 days = 1,500 orders/month
 Net profit per order: €2.30
(after paying drivers, fuel, app maintenance, and marketing)
Monthly:
 Revenue (gross): ~€7,800
 Net Profit: 1,500 × €2.30 = €3,450/month
Annual:
 Net Profit (12 months): €3,450 × 12 = €41,400/year
📦 7.2 Parcel Subscription – Forecast
Assumptions:
 150 subscribers (mixed tiers)
 Avg. net profit per subscriber/month: €23
(after driver salary, fuel, logistics, app support)
Monthly:
 Net Profit: 150 × €23 = €3,450/month
Annual:
 Net Profit (12 months): €3,450 × 12 = €41,400/year
💼 7.3 Consolidated Forecast
Revenue Stream Monthly Net Profit (€) Annual Net Profit (€)
Food Delivery €3,450 €41,400
Parcel Delivery €3,450 €41,400
Total €6,900 €82,800
📉 7.4 Fixed Costs & Expenses
Item Monthly (€) Annual (€) Notes
Part-time driver salary €600 €7,200 Covers parcel delivery only
Fuel & maintenance €150 €1,800 Van fuel + occasional repairs
App maintenance €300 €3,600 External software team
Marketing €400 €4,800 Ads, flyers, social media
Gestor (accounting) €150 €1,800 Autónomo declarations, later SL
Office supplies €100 €1,200 WiFi, print, packaging
Total Fixed Costs €1,700 €20,400
💵 7.5 Annual Net Profit (After Expenses)
 Gross Profit (Annual): €82,800
 Fixed Costs (Annual): €20,400
 Net Profit (Pre-Tax): €62,400
🔄 7.6 Break-Even Analysis
One-Time Investment:
 Startup investment: €5,000 (from founders)
Monthly Break-Even Point:
 Fixed monthly costs: €1,700
 Profit per food order: €2.30
 Break-even orders:
€1,700 ÷ €2.30 ≈ 740 orders/month
≈ 25 orders/day
✅ This is well below the expected 50 daily orders, meaning the company is expected to
reach operational break-even from Month 1.
📊 7.7 Future Scalability
By increasing:
 Orders to 75/day → +€1,725/month
 Subscribers to 250 → +€2,300/month
Net profit could reach €11,000+/month, opening doors for:
 Expansion to other towns
 SL incorporation
 Driver fleet growth
 App feature expansion
 External investment attraction
⚠️ 8. RISK ANALYSIS & MITIGATION
No startup is without risks — but WeGo stands out by anticipating them early and building
safeguards into its model. This section outlines potential threats across five key areas and
the strategies in place to minimize or eliminate their impact.
🧭 1. Operational Risks
Risk: Delivery Delays or Missed Orders
 Especially in campo areas with difficult terrain or during peak hours
Mitigation:
 Driver routes optimized through in-app mapping and daily pre-planning
 Set realistic delivery time windows (not false “30 min” promises)
 Push notifications for updates and delivery ETA
 Option to schedule orders or subscriptions in advance
Risk: Driver Absence or Fatigue
 Initial stage relies heavily on founders and one part-time driver
Mitigation:
 Backup pool of freelancers (commission-based drivers) to activate when needed
 Shift-based scheduling once volumes grow
 Long-term: hire part-time driver #2 after 200 orders/day threshold
🖥️ 2. Technology Risks
Risk: App Bugs or Downtime
 Glitches in order processing, driver GPS, or payment systems could affect trust
Mitigation:
 Partnership with professional development team for active monitoring
 Monthly tech support contract (€300) in place
 Hosting with automatic failover and backups
 Beta-testing period before launch
Risk: Security Breaches / GDPR Violations
 Sensitive customer and payment data must be protected
Mitigation:
 Fully encrypted user data
 Secure payment gateway with PCI compliance
 Clear Terms & Conditions & privacy policy vetted by legal counsel
 Option for users to delete their data upon request
💶 3. Financial Risks
Risk: Not Reaching Target Order/Subscriber Volume
Mitigation:
 Conservative break-even point (25 orders/day only)
 Recurring revenue from parcel subscriptions stabilizes cash flow
 Aggressive local marketing + referral rewards
 Monthly financial reviews to adjust pricing, ads, or routes fast
Risk: Unexpected Cost Increases (fuel, software, drivers)
Mitigation:
 Delivery routes grouped to minimize km
 Contracts with fixed salary for parcel delivery drivers (no surprises)
 Emergency reserve from monthly net profit (~€500 saved/month)
📉 4. Market Risks
Risk: Lack of Awareness or Slow Adoption
Mitigation:
 Flyers, social media videos, and local partnerships before launch
 Community-first approach (focus on campo needs)
 Free first delivery campaign
 English-Spanish bilingual content
Risk: New Competitor Enters the Market
Mitigation:
 First-mover advantage in campo zones
 WeGo offers parcel subscription — a service no current competitor has
 Long-term client retention through loyalty program, excellent support, and delivery
accuracy
🧭⚖️ 5. Legal & Regulatory Risks
Risk: Lack of Permits / Delayed Authorizations
Mitigation:
 WeGo founders working under legal autónomo status at launch
 Plan to form SL company once revenue justifies transition
 Proactive gestor (accounting/legal advisor) included in fixed costs
 Application for applicable grants and subsidies
🧭 Summary of Risk Position
Risk Category Status Mitigation Strength
Operational Managed ✅ Strong
Technical Controlled ✅ Strong
Financial Conservative ✅ Moderate-Strong
Market Awareness Actively addressed ✅ Strong
Legal/Compliance Under control ✅ Strong
✅ WeGo is structurally low-risk thanks to:
 Simple unit economics
 Local-first domination strategy

🤝 Company Culture & Leadership Style
WeGo is built on shared ownership, local pride, and a community-first attitude. The
founders are not removed executives – they’re on the ground, face-to-face with customers
and partners, delivering packages and creating content side by side.
As the company grows, WeGo plans to promote from within, offering long-term contributors
the opportunity to take leadership positions across towns and regions.
🌱 10. SUSTAINABILITY & ESG COMMITMENT
WeGo is not just a delivery app. It's a socially conscious mobility solution that fills critical
infrastructure gaps in under-served rural areas. From its first day, WeGo has been designed
to align with the key principles of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) values —
not just because it's ethical, but because it’s smart business.
♻️ Environmental Responsibility
While delivery apps can contribute to increased vehicle use and emissions, WeGo has a
proactive plan to minimize its environmental footprint, especially in rural settings.
🌍 Green Practices
 Optimized delivery routes: Grouping parcels and food orders per zone to avoid
unnecessary km
 Single driver for bulk parcel delivery each day to reduce fuel use
 Digital-first operation: Receipts, notifications, and records are all paperless
 Electric vehicles: Long-term plan to transition to electric vans for campo delivery by
Year 3
🌳 Future Green Goals
 Partner with reforestation projects to plant a tree for every 500 orders delivered
 Encourage local shops and restaurants to adopt eco-packaging
 Offer in-app rewards for customers who request grouped delivery to save emissions
🤝 Social Impact
WeGo’s business model was born from the injustice of inaccessibility. People in the
campo and elderly residents were cut off from delivery services available to towns. WeGo
restores equity through smart logistics and a deep understanding of the local community.
👵 Social Inclusion
 We deliver where no one else does – elderly, remote, or car-less users are our
priority
 The app is multilingual (Spanish, English) to include locals and foreign residents
 Subscription parcel delivery ensures predictable pricing and reliability for families
💼 Job Creation
 WeGo provides fair, legal employment through autónomo contracts and fixed salary
positions
 Supports rural micro-economies by partnering with small businesses and
restaurants
 Creates opportunities for young locals in logistics, marketing, and customer service
🧭 Governance & Transparency
WeGo will operate with full legal compliance, transparent pricing, and responsible
leadership.
📋 Current Practices
 Operating legally as autónomos, with all activities reported to Spanish authorities
 Clear Terms & Conditions, refund policies, and user data protection (GDPRcompliant)
 Monthly financial reviews to track performance and make responsible decisions
🧭⚖️ Future Governance
 Formation of Sociedad Limitada (SL) once monthly revenue exceeds €6,000
 Appointment of a gestor to manage reporting, taxes, and compliance
 Creation of a Code of Ethics for drivers and staff, including non-discrimination and
customer respect
🛠️ Government Grant Alignment
WeGo is well-positioned to apply for regional or national funding in Spain, especially
through:
 Startup grants for digital innovation
 Rural accessibility improvement funds
 Green mobility pilot initiatives
 Programs supporting women entrepreneurs and digital inclusion
All business plan elements (subscription model, app control, fixed rural employment, ecostrategy) support a strong application.

🚀 11. CONCLUSION & LONG-TERM VISION
🧭 Mission Summary
WeGo was created out of a need no other app was solving:
Rural people — campo residents, elderly locals, working families — had no access to the
digital convenience others enjoy.
WeGo bridges that gap. It delivers food, parcels, and freedom.
🔥 Traction & Viability
From Day 1, WeGo is:
 Operating in underserved, competition-free zones
 Profitable at just 25 food orders/day
 Bolstered by dual income streams: food delivery + recurring parcel subscriptions
 Managed by hands-on founders with local trust and experience
 Backed by a business plan with clear milestones, forecasts, and risk control
🏗️ Scalable by Design
WeGo isn’t just a local app. It’s a framework for rural delivery dominance — first in
Axarquía, then across Spain, then across Europe.
How WeGo Scales:
1. Proven unit economics (low cost, predictable margin)
2. Repeatable tech stack (custom-owned, white-label ready)
3. Franchiseable delivery model (hire/train local teams)
4. ESG-driven reputation (ideal for grant and investor funding)
WeGo is the Glovo for people Glovo ignores.
💸 Exit or Long-Term Ownership?
Our vision is ambitious, clear, and unapologetic:
“We want to bring this company to the point where it can be sold or valued at €1 billion —
not just because we want success, but because we know our impact deserves it.”
This means:
 Building real infrastructure
 Owning the technology
 Documenting everything for scale
 Making a difference for people no one else thinks about
Whether through strategic acquisition by a major logistics or food tech company, or longterm ownership through franchising and international expansion — WeGo will grow until no
one is left without access.
✨ Final Words
WeGo is not built on hype — it's built on need, community, and execution.
It’s a startup born from personal effort, local connection, and smart numbers.
What started in Frigiliana is just the beginning.
You don’t need to go.
WeGo.
