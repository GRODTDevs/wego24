## üìà Business Projections & Technical KPIs

- **Break-even for Subscription Service:** 54 clients at ‚Ç¨15/month covers all fixed costs; client #55+ is profit.
- **Food Delivery Break-even:** 60 paid orders/month covers costs; every order after is profit.
- **LTV:CAC Ratio:** 17‚Äì18:1 (exceptional; industry target is 3:1+).
- **Growth Targets:**
  - Year 1: 700+ subscription clients, ‚Ç¨10.5k/month sub revenue, ‚Ç¨13k/month food revenue, ‚Ç¨7k+ net profit/month.
  - Year 3: 1,600+ subscribers, ‚Ç¨24k/month sub revenue, ‚Ç¨26k/month food revenue, ‚Ç¨20k+ net profit/month.
- **Investor ROI:** Projected 10‚Äì12√ó ROI in 3 years; DCF business valuation ~‚Ç¨324k.

**How the Platform Supports These Goals:**
- **Automated Order Assignment:** Maximizes driver utilization, reduces delivery times, and supports scaling by ensuring every order is matched to the best available driver in real time. This is critical for hitting break-even and profit targets, as it increases order throughput and reduces idle time/costs.
- **Admin Override:** Admins can manually assign or reassign drivers, ensuring operational flexibility and reliability even if automation fails or special handling is needed.
- **Real-time Metrics & Analytics:** Track orders, revenue, user growth, and driver/partner performance to optimize operations and marketing spend. These KPIs are directly mapped to business projections and are essential for monitoring LTV, CAC, and profit margins.
- **System Health Monitoring:** Ensures uptime and reliability, critical for customer trust and retention, and for maintaining high net profit margins as projected.
- **Subscription & Usage Tracking:** Enforces plan limits, supports upsell/cross-sell, and enables dynamic pricing, all of which are key to maximizing LTV and scaling profitably.
- **Admin Dashboards:** Enable rapid response to operational issues, partner/driver management, and business decision-making, supporting the growth and scaling targets in the projections.
- **Testing & QA:** Automated business logic and integration tests ensure pricing, payouts, and KPIs are always accurate, supporting investor confidence and operational excellence.

**Order Automation & Tracking: The Technical Value**
- Automated order assignment and tracking are the backbone of WeGo‚Äôs operational efficiency. By minimizing manual intervention, the platform can scale to hundreds or thousands of orders/month without a linear increase in admin or support staff.
- Real-time driver and order tracking enables route optimization, clustered deliveries, and dynamic pricing, all of which directly improve profit margins and customer satisfaction.
- The system‚Äôs ability to track every order, driver, and delivery in real time is what enables the business to hit and exceed the financial projections outlined above.

**Summary:**
The technical platform is designed to directly support WeGo‚Äôs business model, growth, and profitability. Every dashboard metric, automation, and alert is mapped to a real business KPI, ensuring that as the platform scales, so does the business value and investor appeal.
