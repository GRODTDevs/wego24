# WeGo - Multi-Platform Delivery & Service Application

## Project Overview

WeGo is a comprehensive delivery and service platform built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase. The platform connects customers, restaurant partners, and delivery drivers in a seamless ecosystem for food delivery and courier services.

**Live URL**: https://wego24.es

## Business Plan Scope

### Executive Summary
WeGo is a next-generation delivery platform tailored for under-served communities in Andalusia, Spain, starting with Frigiliana and Torrox. Unlike major competitors (Glovo, UberEats, Deliveroo) that focus on urban centers, WeGo is purpose-built to reach campo areas (rural countryside zones) where delivery infrastructure is nonexistent.

### Dual Revenue Model
1. **Food Delivery Service** - On-demand food ordering with €2.50 base fee + €0.99/km
2. **Parcel Subscription Service** - Monthly plans (€15-€55) for regular parcel delivery to campo areas

### Key Business Metrics (Phase 1: 150 active clients)
- **Target**: 50 orders/day × 30 days = 1,500 monthly orders
- **Average Order Value**: €9.50
- **Revenue per Order**: ~€7 (delivery fee + restaurant markup)
- **Monthly Net Profit**: €6,900 (combined streams)
- **Annual Projection**: €82,800

### Market Positioning
- **First-mover advantage** in campo delivery zones
- **Underserved market**: Elderly residents, expats, remote workers
- **Unique value proposition**: "You don't need to go. WeGo."
- **Competition-free zones** in rural Andalusia

### Growth Timeline
- **Q3 2025**: Launch in Frigiliana + Torrox
- **Q4 2025**: Expand to Nerja, Maro, Cómpeta
- **2026**: Transition to Sociedad Limitada (SL) + scale driver network
- **2027-2028**: 500+ subscribers, expand across Andalusia
- **2029-2030**: Franchise model or acquisition opportunity
