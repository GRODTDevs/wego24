## Partner Registration Process

### How It Works

1. **Application Submission**
   - Partners visit `/partner-register` (requires login)
   - Fill out comprehensive business information form
   - Submit application with business details, contact info, and description

2. **Application Review**
   - Applications stored in `partner_applications` table with "pending" status
   - Admin reviews through Product Owner Dashboard
   - Admin can approve or reject with reason

3. **Approval Process**
   - Upon approval, system automatically:
     - Creates restaurant record in `restaurants` table
     - Links restaurant to partner user via `restaurant_users` table
     - Sets up default restaurant settings
     - Updates application status to "approved"

4. **Partner Dashboard Access**
   - Approved partners get access to `/partner/dashboard`
   - Can manage restaurant information
   - Access to menu management
   - Order processing capabilities

### Application Requirements
