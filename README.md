# WeGo - Multi-Platform Delivery & Service Application

## Project Overview

WeGo is a comprehensive delivery and service platform built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase. The platform connects customers, restaurant partners, and delivery drivers in a seamless ecosystem for food delivery and courier services.

**Live URL**: https://wego24.es

## Business Plan Scope

### Executive Summary
WeGo is a next-generation delivery platform tailored for under-served communities in Andalusia, Spain, starting with Frigiliana and Torrox. Unlike major competitors (Glovo, UberEats, Deliveroo) that focus on urban centers, WeGo is purpose-built to reach campo areas (rural countryside zones) where delivery infrastructure is nonexistent.

### Dual Revenue Model
1. **Food Delivery Service** - On-demand food ordering with €2.50 base fee + €0.99/km
2. **Parcel Subscription Service** - Monthly plans (€15-€55) for regular parcel delivery to campo areas

### Key Business Metrics (Phase 1: 150 active clients)
- **Target**: 50 orders/day × 30 days = 1,500 monthly orders
- **Average Order Value**: €9.50
- **Revenue per Order**: ~€7 (delivery fee + restaurant markup)
- **Monthly Net Profit**: €6,900 (combined streams)
- **Annual Projection**: €82,800

### Market Positioning
- **First-mover advantage** in campo delivery zones
- **Underserved market**: Elderly residents, expats, remote workers
- **Unique value proposition**: "You don't need to go. WeGo."
- **Competition-free zones** in rural Andalusia

### Growth Timeline
- **Q3 2025**: Launch in Frigiliana + Torrox
- **Q4 2025**: Expand to Nerja, Maro, Cómpeta
- **2026**: Transition to Sociedad Limitada (SL) + scale driver network
- **2027-2028**: 500+ subscribers, expand across Andalusia
- **2029-2030**: Franchise model or acquisition opportunity

## Current System Status - January 2025

### Critical Business Gaps Identified ❌

#### 1. **Subscription Billing System** - PRIORITY 1
- **Status**: ⚠️ Framework exists, core functionality missing
- **Current**: Database schema and basic Stripe setup
- **Missing Critical Features**:
  - Recurring billing automation (€15-€55 monthly plans)
  - Usage tracking and quota enforcement
  - Customer self-service portal
  - Plan upgrade/downgrade flows
  - Payment failure handling
- **Business Impact**: **Cannot generate subscription revenue** (50% of target income)

#### 2. **Real-Time Order Management** - PRIORITY 2
- **Status**: ⚠️ Partially Implemented

  - Automated driver assignment and dispatch
  - Customer notification system (SMS + Push notifications)
  - Restaurant order processing workflow
- **Business Impact**: **Cannot process orders efficiently** (operational chaos)

#### 3. **Campo-Specific Features** - PRIORITY 3

- **Required for Market Differentiation**:
  - Rural address validation and mapping
  - Distance-based pricing calculation (€2.50 + €0.99/km)
  - Offline-capable functionality for poor connectivity
  - Custom delivery instructions for remote properties
- **Business Impact**: **Cannot serve target market** (unique value proposition lost)

#### 4. **Driver Commission System** - PRIORITY 4
- **Status**: ⚠️ Basic Structure Only
- **Current**: Driver table and basic management
- **Missing**:
  - Automated commission tracking (€1.00 + €0.30/km)
  - Payout calculations and scheduling
  - Performance analytics and driver ratings
  - Real-time availability management
- **Business Impact**: **Manual driver management** (not scalable)

#### 5. **Spanish Market Integration** - PRIORITY 5
- **Status**: ❌ Not Started
- **Required for Legal Compliance**:
  - Spanish payment providers (Redsys integration)
  - IVA tax system integration (21% VAT)
  - GDPR compliance enhancements
  - Multi-currency support (EUR focus)
- **Business Impact**: **Legal compliance issues** (cannot operate in Spain)

### Testing & Quality Assurance ❌
- **Status**: ❌ No automated testing implemented
- **Critical Need**: Unit tests for authentication, integration tests for payment flows
