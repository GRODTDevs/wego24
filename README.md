## Developer Authentication

### Flow

1. Navigate to `/dev-login`.

2. Enter the developer password (configured via environment variables `VITE_DEV_LOGIN_PASSWORD` or `REACT_APP_DEV_PASSWORD`)

3. Upon successful authentication, a session is stored in `sessionStorage` with the following structure:

   ```json
   {
     "token": "randomUUID",
     "expires": "timestamp",
     "authenticated": true
   }
   ```

4. The session is validated on each protected route.

### Notes

- Sessions expire after 2 hours.

- If the session is invalid or expired, the user is redirected to `/dev-login`.

- The header is hidden on the `/dev-login` page to prevent unauthorized access to navigation.

- **Production Note**: Developer authentication should be disabled in production by removing the `VITE_DEV_LOGIN_PASSWORD` or `REACT_APP_DEV_PASSWORD` environment variables.

## üìù Changelog

### Recent Updates

- **Developer Authentication**: Simplified logic to ensure robust session handling and consistent use of `sessionStorage`. Updated `/dev-login` to hide the header and redirect unauthenticated users.
- **Translation Fixes**: Restored and refactored translation keys for homepage, partner register, and courier request sections.
- **Partner Registration**: Populated business types dropdown via translation context.
- **Error Handling**: Fixed repeated redirects and 404s in developer authentication flow.
- **PartnerApplications**: Enhanced error handling in the approval process to provide more descriptive error messages and log errors for debugging.
- **create_restaurant_from_application**: Added validation for required fields and logging for restaurant creation to ensure data integrity and traceability.

## Maintenance Mode

The platform supports a global maintenance mode, which can be toggled by an admin from the Operations Dashboard.

- **When enabled:**
  - Only authenticated admin users can access any part of the app.
  - All other users (including public and unauthenticated users) see a maintenance/lockdown page, regardless of the route.
  - The /auth route remains accessible so users can log in, but only admins can proceed past authentication.
- **When disabled:**
  - The app operates normally, with public and protected routes accessible as per user roles.

**How to use:**
- Go to the Operations Dashboard as an admin.
- Toggle the maintenance mode switch.
- The change takes effect immediately for all users.
