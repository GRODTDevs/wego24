- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Vite** - Fast development server and build tool
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn/ui** - Modern React component library
- **React Router DOM** - Client-side routing
- **React Query (@tanstack/react-query)** - Server state management

### Backend & Database
- **Supabase** - Backend-as-a-Service
  - PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security (RLS)
  - Real-time subscriptions
  - Authentication & authorization
  - Edge functions for custom logic
  - File storage capabilities

### Key Features

#### For Customers
- Browse restaurants and services
- Search and filter locations
- Request courier services
- Multi-language support (EN/ES/DE)
- User authentication and profiles

#### For Partners (Restaurants/Businesses)
- Partner application system
- Restaurant dashboard and management
- Menu and product management
- Order processing
- Settings and configuration

#### For Administrators
- Partner application review and approval
- User management
- System-wide settings
- Analytics and reporting

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **restaurants** - Restaurant/business information
- **partner_applications** - Partner registration applications
- **restaurant_users** - Restaurant staff and ownership relationships
- **menu_categories** - Menu organization
- **menu_items** - Products and services
- **profiles** - User profile information
- **user_roles** - Role-based access control

### Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables
- Role-based access control (admin, user)
- Restaurant-specific data isolation
- Secure authentication with Supabase Auth

## Partner Registration Process

### How It Works

1. **Application Submission**
   - Partners visit `/partner-register` (requires login)
   - Fill out comprehensive business information form
   - Submit application with business details, contact info, and description

2. **Application Review**
   - Applications stored in `partner_applications` table with "pending" status
   - Admin reviews through Product Owner Dashboard
   - Admin can approve or reject with reason

3. **Approval Process**
   - Upon approval, system automatically:
     - Creates restaurant record in `restaurants` table
     - Links restaurant to partner user via `restaurant_users` table
     - Sets up default restaurant settings
     - Updates application status to "approved"

4. **Partner Dashboard Access**
   - Approved partners get access to `/partner/dashboard`
   - Can manage restaurant information
   - Access to menu management (future feature)
   - Order processing capabilities (future feature)

### Application Requirements
- Business name and type
- Contact email and phone
- Complete business address
- Business description (optional)
- Valid user account (must be logged in)

## Current System Status

### Implemented Features ‚úÖ
- User authentication and authorization
- Multi-language support (EN/ES/DE)
- Partner registration system
- Admin dashboard for application review
- Partner dashboard with basic restaurant management
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Location browsing and search
- Courier request system

### Known Issues & Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **File Management**
   - Several files are getting large and should be refactored:
     - `src/pages/Index.tsx` (210+ lines)

   - Order processing system
   - Payment integration
   - Driver/courier management
   - Real-time order tracking
   - Review and rating system

3. **Technical Debt**
   - Large components need breaking into smaller, focused components
   - Some duplicate code in translation contexts
   - Could benefit from custom hooks for data fetching
